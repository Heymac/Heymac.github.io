				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<span>To design a commuter bicycle that allows customizability and adaptability for carrying various types of cargo through a modular construction.</span>
			</div>

			<div class="heading">
				<h2>Research</h2>
				<span>Initially the group observed cyclists on streets corners in Atlanta, interviewed bike riders and bike shops, and took contextual photos.</span>
			</div>

			<div class="triple-photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context1.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context6.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context4.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="triple-photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context5.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context3.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Context2.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>We then posted this information on a board and made notes about significant findings for each photo and other interesting points we heard during the interviews.</span>
			</div>

			<div class="double-photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Notes1.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Notes2.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>We identified three different target scenarios:</span>
			</div>

			<div class="round-cont padding">
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points1.jpg">
					<span>Commuting</span>
					<span>The cyclists that we interviewed greatly preferred cycling to work over driving a car, expressing that it is actually more convenient.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points2.jpg">
					<span>Errand Running</span>
					<span>Many of them did not own a car at all, or if they did, they still relied on their bike to run errands such as getting groceries, etc.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points3.jpg">
					<span>Recreational</span>
					<span>These riders bike for fun and exercise in addition to biking for practicality. They shared the sentiment that “biking is my social scene”.</span>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>As well as three different pain points that riders experience in each category:</span>
			</div>

			<div class="round-cont padding">
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points4.jpg">
					<span>Preparation</span>
					<span>Riding a bike as a commuter isn’t as simple as get on and go. Routes, clothes, position of bags on the bike, and storage for what you might take are all considerations that have to be made.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points5.jpg">
					<span>Improper Storage</span>
					<span>Many cyclists find themselves unable to take things with them because they don’t have the right mountings or bags on their bike. They are forced to improvise or devise inadequate solutions.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="round-photo photo">
					<img src="./assets/Pal/Points6.jpg">
					<span>Backpacks</span>
					<span>Wearing a backpack on a bike during warmer seasons is uncomfortable to say the least. Add the heavier loads that some cyclists carry, such as groceries, and you have a recipe for back pain and a top heavy bike.</span>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="center-title">
				<span>Key Items Carried:</span>
			</div>
			<div class="photo padding">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Items.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="center-title">
				<span>Typical Daily Routine</span>
			</div>
			<div class="photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Timeline.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>From these insights we were able to create three specific criteria that the bicycle should fulfill:</span>
			</div>

			<div class="objectives">
				<div class="mainGoal">
					<div class="goal">
						<span>1.</span>
						<span>The bicycle MUST be able to store whatever the rider carries with them.</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="subGoals">
					<div class="goal">
						<span>2.</span>
						<span>The bicycle SHOULD allow for spontaneity i.e. on-the-go configuration.</span>
					</div>
					<div class="goal">
						<span>3.</span>
						<span>The bicycle COULD facilitate some kind of community building.</span>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="heading">
				<h2>Concept Development</h2>
				<span>During this phase the group developed three refined concepts, one of which was evaluated as having the most value for our users and had met our criteria, and was moved forward.</span>
			</div>

			<div class="photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Concepts1.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="double-photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Concepts2.jpg">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/MoodBoard.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>We took our ideas into VR and sculpted them in Gravity Sketch to get an idea of the form and dimensions in three dimensions. This allowed us to iterate on these concepts as well as sculpting new forms onto the existing ones and evaluating them at full scale. From this experience we decided on the internal truss structure for the bike.</span>
			</div>

			<div class="photo">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/Concepts3.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="heading">
				<h2>Final Design</h2>
				<span>The bicycle frame was then modeled in Fusion 360 and 3D printed. All other components are off-the-shelf parts that could be sourced easily by a manufacturer.</span>

					<span>A front basket can be inserted into the front of the bike via the triangle peg attachment.</span>

				<h2>Brand Launch</h2>
				<span>The second part of this project consisted of designing a pop-up shop or launch space along the Atlanta Belt Line (a pedestrian and bicycle walkway that goes through the city) that would be the main point of purchase for our yet to be released bicycle. Our objectives are below:</span>
			</div>

			<div class="photo max-padding">
				<img src="./assets/Pal/PopupCriteria.jpg">
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>We spent a few days scouting locations along the West End Atlanta Beltline looking for spots that were near local community businesses. We found a newly landscaped area behind Boxcar at Hop City West End that we felt would suit our purposes.</span>
			</div>

				<span>Nearby Brewery</span>
			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>We then started sketching and refining different layouts for the space, eventually modeling our top two and again taking them into VR for evaluation in three dimensions.</span>

			</div>

			<div class="blurb">
				<span>Taking into account our size constraints and the number of areas needed, we decided on the left concept and created a finalized VR simulation of the space that could be toured virtually.</span>
